GAIA CORE PHP SHARED LIBRARIES
==============================
The components in this library are open sourced versions of code patterns that have been working for Gaia Interactive for years.

Continued at the project [Wiki Home](https://github.com/gaiaops/gaia_core_php/wiki/).


REQUIREMENTS
==============================
This library was designed to run on top of a LAMP (Linux, Apache 2.x+, some modern popular open-source RDBMS such as MySQL 5+, and PHP 5.3+) stack.
You are expected to have installed Apache2 with mod_rewrite, PHP 5.3+ with the database and cache drivers that you expect to run (such as MySQLi, Memcache / Memcached, APC, etc).
Make sure php has bcmath and mbstring enabled.

GETTING STARTED
==============================
Peruse the [Top level Module Documentation](https://github.com/gaiaops/gaia_core_php/wiki/_pages).

In the future, we may try to make the library PHPDoc compliant.
